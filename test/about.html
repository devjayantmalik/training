        <p class="description">
          In a spell of dry weather, when the Birds could find very little to
          drink, a thirsty Crow found a pitcher with a little water in it. But
          the pitcher was high and had a narrow neck, and no matter how he
          tried, the Crow could not reach the water. The poor thing felt as if
          he must die of thirst.
        </p>
        <p class="description mt-20">
          Then an idea came to him. Picking up some small pebbles, he dropped
          them into the pitcher one by one. With each pebble the water rose a
          little higher until at last it was near enough so he could drink.
